The task:

Sandwich café (ADT: stack, queue). 

The café has two sandwich dispensers, and customers can only take the top sandwich from each dispenser. New sandwiches can also only be placed on top of the stack. At any one time, no more than one customer orders a sandwich and takes it from any of the dispensers. The kitchen is regularly stocked with new sandwiches, which are placed in the dispenser with the fewest sandwiches at that moment. In the evening, any remaining sandwiches are checked, and those that have been lying around too long are discarded.

Baseline data for the café includes the probability that at any given time, the number and frequency of sandwiches served from the kitchen, the duration of time a sandwich is kept before being discarded in the evening, the price per sandwich, and the length of the working day.

Estimate the potential reduction in losses for the café if it were to replace its existing sandwich dispensers with one or two new ones, where customers are required to take the oldest sandwich.
